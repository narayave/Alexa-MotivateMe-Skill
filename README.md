# Alexa - Motivate Me Skill

This is a simple Alexa Skill Development experiment. There were primarily 3 steps I had to follow.
1. Set up Lambda function on AWS.
2. Start new skill on Alexa skill developer console.
3. Learn about Intents (and slots).
4. Skill configuration to point to said lambda function.
5. Need to get it tested. (I essentially only sent it to myself and had my dad test it.)
6. Send it for certification.

* Add more quotes. Or figure out a way to query for them.
* Add authors of the quotes. Initial set of quotes grabbed from https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/247213.
